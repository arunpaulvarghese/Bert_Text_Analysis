You're pretty close.  One of the most important features of a 'security camera&#34; is the ability to detect motion and record, especially when running on battery and limited storage space.  I tested the motion detect on this camera in a few different environments so far (i.e. low light, indoors, outdoors, etc..) and all I got was a SD card full of video triggers.  All the testing was done with the low motion sensitivity setting.  I can't even imagine what the high one would be.<br />As others said, the low light operation is poor.  I did one of my tests outdoors as the sun was setting.  It was good until a point - then the camera started having seizures..it got fuzzy, went to black and white...back to color...then ultimately stabilized with lines across the screen.<br />Another oddity I noticed was that the firmware reported in the windows config tool seemed later than the latest version posed on the Zetta site.  I'm not exactly sure why that is.<br /><br />It gets two stars because there was one time, in a very light controlled indoor environment, where it didn't constantly trigger, so it MAY have some usefulness for your particular situation.  In adequate light, the video isn't too bad (you don't need HD for most security applications).<br /><br />The are a variety of settings that are configurable, which is quite nice.  One setting that could, and should, be configurable is the amount of time it will record after the last trigger is detected.  The manual states that this is 5 minutes.  So, if someone enters the picture for 30 seconds then leaves, you conceivably would have 5 minutes of recording nothing afterwards.  This isn't power or memory efficient.<br /><br />My original thought was to return this, but I want to crack it open and look at some of the internals.  I may decide to make my own.<br /><br />I will continue to test and report any new developments.",31/08/15

US,28282645,R3MBE6UCH3435E,B00TE8XKIS,35563334,Polaroid ZIP Mobile Printer Parent ASIN,Camera,3,8,8,N,N,"Fun toy for making stickers, but expensive to play with.","The printer came in a small fairly plain box with decent packaging.  Upon opening the packaging it comes with a pack of paper, and a pain charging cable.  On the plus side it comes fully charged and ready to print<br /><br />I went to load the paper into the printer, and there are warnings about not to bend the paper, leave it in the car, standard stuff.  Loading the printer was as easy as sliding the top off, and dropping the pack barcode down in the printer.  Getting the top back on required a few flips to find the right direction since it doesn't clearly line up which side the top slides back on from.<br /><br />Note that the 2x3 print size is actually very small.  This should be obvious by the sizing, but make sure you understand what you are buying.  These aren't normal 3x5 photos even.<br /><br />My first attempt to print was using a non rooted android one plus one running lollipop(oxygen OS).  I went to the app store and downloaded the Zink app.  For some reason the app caused my phone to work very hard and heat up, I haven't had issues with other apps doing this.  One thing I did notice while using the app was NFC options.  Which is neat you just put your phone on the printer and it loads up the app for you, very convenient and a nice touch.<br /><br />While using the app it crashed several times on initial launch.  I tried to bluetooth pair the printer outside of the app and after a few attempts I was able to get it to pair.  However I was unable to print from the app with pairing the printer from the standard android bluetooth menu. I deleted the pairing and initiated the pair from within the app, this time it worked.<br /><br />When I finally got the printer working it popped up telling me there was a critical firmware update for the printer.  I let it download and apply the update via bluetooth.  It took about 5 minutes to update, and the instructions said to wait for the printer to restart.  The printer never restarted and required a power on, but the update worked successfully.<br /><br />I did find quite a few issues with the app.  The estimated percentage complete for sending to printer / printing was wildly inaccurate.  I received several out of memory errors when trying to load larger pictures.<br /><br />I also tried the same setup from an iPhone 6.  I downloaded the app, but was not given an option to pair bluetooth from within the app.  I did it from the system menu and it worked fine.  I didn't experience any crashes with smaller pictures.  The percentage completion bar was also more accurate.<br /><br />Printing take approximately 40 seconds to send to printer, and another 35 seconds to print.  While the printer is printing, it is pretty quiet.  It does have a bit of a high pitch tone to it, which could get annoying to some people.  The first print takes a bit longer since it &#34;prints&#34; the barcode you use when loading the printer.<br /><br />As for the quality of the prints, I used very high resolution DSLR pictures to try to pull the best photos possible from the little printer.  I noticed the colors are slightly muted, and the picture overall a bit darker.  Contrast was fairly low and there was a brownish tint to the photos, which almost looked like the standard instagram filter.  There was discoloring around the edges, and darker parts of photos were crushed into black. Some of the patterns such as on shirts, or with strands of hair remained, but gradual transitions looked muddy and unable to differentiate.<br /><br />The resolution was OK for the size of the photo.  They look fine from 1-2ft away.  Some of the photos I printed I aimed to capitalize on the look of the prints, including a nearly black and white photo of a flower.  These turned out really well.  While printing photos straight from the iPhone / One Plus One's camera resulted in even more muddying and lack of definition.<br /><br />I was not able to smudge the images after printing, and the printer didn't seem to get too hot.  Based on battery life I would estimate around 10-15 prints max per charge.  There is an auto power off setting, but it seems the actual printing takes the majority of the battery.<br /><br />The prints end up being very expensive with the proprietary paper you have to buy.  Instead of making money on ink/film/the device, they are clearly aiming to make the profit on the paper.  Also note that I was provided a sample of this product for my unbiased review.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------<br />Pros:<br />* Cool concept<br />* Makes stickers<br />* Decent battery life<br />* Fairly quick printing<br /><br />Cons:<br />* The quality of prints are low<br />* Android app needs work<br />* Very expensive per print<br />* Very small print size.<br /><br />In conclusion I would say this printer would be neat to print a quick sticker to put on something.  Or for younger kids to enjoy the printed results.  These are obviously not archival quality, or even enough quality to give to family members.  The expensive cost of prints may be a big limiting factor to the amount of use you will get out of this printer.d on battery life I would estimate around 10-15 prints max per charge.

The box contains the following:<br />â€¢ The camera<br />â€¢ Ethernet (network) cable<br />â€¢ Power adapter<br />â€¢ Mounting bracket, with screws and wall plugs<br />â€¢ Software CD (Mini CD)<br />â€¢ Manual<br /><br />The camera housing is made of shiny black plastic but it feels nicely weighted and solid. There's a wifi antenna on the back (it doesn't appear to be replaceable, unfortunately), a Micro SD/SDHC card slot (documentation claims that cards up to 32GB are supported - I had no problems using a 32GB card), an Ethernet port and a socket for the power adapter. The manual is surprisingly good - it covers the initial setup steps clearly. The manual and provided software is also available online (see below).<br /><br />Setup is straightforward. I connected it to my wired network and it found an IP address within a few seconds. I did initial setup using the Life Online app on my iPhone but it's also possible to use the Tenvis app (available for Apple iOS and Android). The camera supports both wired and wireless connections - the wireless worked fine for me (2.4GHz only) but I prefer using the wired connection for performance/stability reasons. Connectivity to your wireless network can be setup using the app.<br /><br />In addition to managing the camera using a mobile app, there is also a web interface - just browse to the IP address that the camera is on and log in with your administrator username and password. The web interface allows you to configure far more options than the mobile app. For example, it allows for some advanced functions like triggering an ftp upload of a photo/video or email from an alert, which is very useful. If you're unsure of the address of your camera, you can use the provided Tenvis Search Tool, which will find it automatically (this works for Windows and Mac). You can also view the camera feed from the web interface and I had no problem accessing it from a Mac.<br /><br />In use, I'm very impressed with this camera. The image quality is excellent, both during the day and at night, and maximum resolution is 1280x720 (ie 720p). Setting up alerts (to record when movement is detected) is very easy and works well but you will need to provide an SD/SDHC card to record to the camera itself. Another thing I like is that it's easy to move the camera (tilt and pan) remotely. Unfortunately movement below the horizontal is limited, so if you're not using the bracket, don't mount it too high up otherwise you won't be able to see too far below the camera's position. But that's a minor criticism, really.<br /><br />The camera has a built-in microphone and can record audio. I can also be used for two way communication but I found it a bit clunky as you need to switch modes in the app from listening to speaking each time you want to say something and then hear the response.<br /><br />Note: Disable the UPnP and P2P settings on the camera or make sure the appropriate ports are blocked on your router so that your camera is not accessible from the Internet. In the past some models of Tenvis cameras have had security problems (just search online for &#34;Tenvis security hole&#34;) so you *do not* want these cameras exposed to the Internet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Easy to set up<br />+ Very good image quality, both during the day and at night<br />+ Excellent functionality<br />+ Fully-featured web interface<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Limited movement below the horizontal<br />- Two-way audio a bit clunky<br />- Very important: make sure you disable the UPnP/P2P functionality<br /><br />As mentioned, you can download the manuals and additional software online (just search for &#34;Tenvis D200&#34; or &#34;Tenvis TH661&#34; for this particular model).<br /><br />Overall, I'm very impressed with this camera. It offers a lot of features for the money - for under $60, it's a bargain. Highly recommended.

However, if you do not have a CD&#60; you can get the manual and software online.  Assembly was easy and intuitive, taking about one minute.  The software installed on my Dell Windows 7 system with no issues.<br /><br />Simply plug the microscope into the computer and you are off and running.  The software of course interfaces with the computer and does so exceedingly well.  You can even open the interface software to a full window. To view objects, one knob provides general control and the other provides fine tuning.  This is perhaps where a more expensive unit might be better suited for some.  The fine tuning takes effort.  A variable light adjustment is provided on the cable, as well as a trigger/shutter control for the camera. The shutter button works very well and the software provides a means of organizing your images.  It is important to remember that there is no viewing piece on the microscope.  Instead, you view images on your computer.  Magnification, up to 330x, is controlled through the software.<br /><br />The general design of the microscope is good for the intended purpose.  The base is heavy enough and seems secure.  Enough control points are provided, allowing you to hold down slides.  Note-  I was provided a sample for a no obligation review.",31/08/15

The camera itself is good, but I think the app is buggy.  It tends to just sit there and churn when I click on my camera to view it. There is a 2-3 sec delay on the video, which is okay, but sometimes the app freezes, so it doesn't show the correct picture.  However, you can turn the mic on and listen to what is happening?  But what good is that.  You have to manually turn of event recording while you are home, or else you get videos of you and your family doing your normal routines.  The free 1-day cloud storage is good, and most products don't have that.  Quality of the picture is very good whether day or night.  However, if you leave it on auto, it will probably be on night vision (black/white) when not home, as not enough lighting. I have to set it to off during the day, so I can see in color.  Alerts are very good, and spot on.  But I would only use that when away from your house, or else you will get a lot of phone alerts, unless you turn off event recording or the mobile alerts.  I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the phone app.  You can pan/tilt, but it's not a continuous movement, almost in frames, if that makes sense.  You can also manually set to record, but haven't checked to see how long it will run.  Overall good product, just wish they would fix the app issues, because those get frustrating.  Considering sending back and getting something else, but can't seem to find something better in the same price range with free cloud storage.  So really, really hoping they fix the app issues :)",31/08/15

I will note right away, if you do not own an iPhone are android phone this camera will likely not work for you. The setup is done through the app and without a phone that supports the app you will not be able to set the camera up.<br /><br />I found the camera setup to be relativity easy. You plug the camera in and then open up the app on your phone. From there you connect to the camera and setup the wifi password so that it can connect to your home network. One downside I did notice is that there is not a native app for the iPad. Because of this I ended up downloading the iPhone version of the app to my iPad and set it up that way. It would be nice if Kodak would make the app universal so that it wasn't so ugly on the iPad. This was my only complaint with the setup process.<br /><br />Using the camera for daily use is a breeze. The video quality is excellent and the pan/tilt feature allows you to see an entire room easily. The app also works well and allows you to set up notifications to alert you if motion is detected. This ensures that you will not miss anything moving in the room that you have the camera setup in. The app also gives you the ability to speak through a speaker that is on the camera, so if you have a pet you could easily speak to them remotely.<br /><br />Overall I would say that this camera is an excellent option for anyone that is looking for a home security camera. The quality is excellent and while the app is not the greatest, it does do its job well enough.",31/08/15

It does however, fit my brother's Moto G, and my other LG Optimus Fuel smartphone.<br /><br />I'm not sure how often I would use this lens when I can just zoom out.

The cap does come off easily.....maybe a little too easily for me.  I could see it getting lost pretty quickly.<br /><br />I can get similar effect on photos using free editing software.

I would recommend waiting for something better. Also the anti shake makes things worst by creating Z fighting or blurring the video. best keep it off and just use software to try to fix it or better yet just stay with 60fps.",31/08/15

Because the system was outside of the one year warranty period, Defender offered a mere 10% discount on the purchase of a new product. Defender refused to repair the DVR at my expense, so we could only trash the DVR, the heart of the security system, and replace it with a new system. We spent several hundred dollars on the original security system and spent $300 on labor and materials to have the system professionally installed. To have the system fail after a year and five months is unacceptable, particularly when you cannot buy internal replacement parts or have your items repaired. We are very disappointed with Defender's failure to stand behind its products. Below is our conversation with a Defender representative as we attempted to have our issue resolved.<br /><br />Chat Transcript<br /><br />Time of chat: 8/31/2015 9:36:06 AM<br />Length of chat: 00:14:50<br />Your name: William Rooks<br />Chatted with: Kristi<br /><br />9:36 AM Kristi: Hello William Rooks, thank you for your inquiry. I am looking into your question, and will respond shortly<br />9:36 AM William Rooks: Thank you.<br />9:38 AM Kristi: I do apologize for the issue with your DVR.

What was the purchase date of the DVR?<br />9:42 AM William Rooks: March 3, 2014<br />9:42 AM Kristi: At this time, it would regrettably be to far outside of the warranty for us to make an exception, regrettably. I do apologize.<br />9:43 AM William Rooks: It is incredibly frustrating that one year after purchase, Defender no longer repairs its products. I will be leaving a lengthy review on Amazon and on the Defender website.<br />9:44 AM William Rooks: Do you think it is reasonable to have to throw a device away after spending this sort of money on it, particularly when it is only one year and five months old?<br />9:44 AM Kristi: I do understand your frustration with this, and I apologize. We are unable to offer repair work, regrettably.<br />9:46 AM William Rooks: Are you able to offer a larger discount on the products that are listed under &#34;Special Offers&#34; on your website?

Too bad, I really, really wanted this device to be the answer to an otherwise expensive prayer.  I got this for my husband who has been looking at the GoPro devices.  I didn't want him spending $300-400 on a 'toy' so I picked this one out for him.  It seems like a great idea: inexpensive action camera with GoPro mounting compatibility and lots of accessories as well.<br /><br />We got it and he put it on his motorcycle to get some video of his daily commute and travels.  It appears to have worked well for about 25 miles, then the video went wacky; in and out of focus, strange colors (it was shot at night, since that's when he goes to work), so something happened while it was mounted on the bike.  The next morning he shot his ride home during daylight and it became evident what happened: the IR pass filter had come loose and was wiggling about in the housing, causing color and focus issues.<br /><br />Too bad.  We did find the 'entry' level [[ASIN:B00NIYNUXO GoPro HERO (No Wi-Fi)]]and we'll give that a try next, but this one had to go back!  :(  Other than that, this really seemed like a great little unit with features that GoPro has for $300.  Great quality case and the wifi funtionality worked great.  The colors and pictures seemed high quality (until it went south, of course)  If one or the other of these Asian companies would institute a higher level of quality control, they could really rule the action cam market.  Oh well, two stars for the effort though!",31/08/15

We first got the older version of this because it was $20 cheaper. It took 2 hours to figure out how to hook it up to the wifi. Then, when we tried to download the app on our phones, it said it didn't work with the older model. We returned it for this plug and play. You literally just scan the QR Code and within 5 minutes the whole thing is set up and works with the app. Image is fantastic and night vision looks great too. Tons of features that we probably won't even use, but good to have. Also has a mic and speaker so you can hear your baby and talk to them. You can set the volume in the app so that the alarm is more or less sensitive to sound. Highly recommend, especially for under $80!  Update: Feb 2017: Camera has had a lot of glitches over the 1.5yrs we've had it, including disconnecting from the wifi on a regular basis.

Worthless customer support,"I've had Webroot for a few years. It expired and I decided to purchase a renewal on Amazon. I went through hell trying to uninstall the expired version in order to install the new.  I called Webroot and had their representative remote into my computer at his request. He was clueless as a bad joke and consumed 29 minutes and 57 seconds of my time forever.  He initially told me it wasn't compatible with Windows 10, but I finally managed to convince him that it is indeed compatible with Windows 10 as it was working on my computer before it expired and also I showed him a review on Amazon to convince him that it works on Windows 10. Finally, he offered to connect me with a senior consultant for over 100 dollars. I declined and told him I'd fix the issue myself. This guy was less helpful than a severed limb.  After spending some time on Google, the issue is now fixed. Webroot should just get rid of their customer service and pay Google for indexing much more helpful info that their dedicated customer service can offer.  As far as the software itself. I think it scans fast, does not slow down my computer and I hope (like most other people including experts) that it's very effective in removing and preventing malware.  Years ago I did extensive research and found it to be among the best, but that was over 4 years ago. Things are fluid in the malware kingdom.  To those experiencing the same issue installing as I did - My advice - don't bother uninstalling the old version, rather launch webroot and click on  &#34;my account&#34; on the right side, then copy and past your product key in the area that says &#34;enter a new keycode&#34;, then click on Activate. This will save numerous painful hours of trying to get the thing to work.",31/08/15

Installation went without a hitch, and I didn't even need the backup as this installation recognized my file and took over from there with the conversion process: the conversion took some time to complete, so if you are doing an upgrade go find something to do around the house vs. sitting there staring at your computer.<br /><br />For the new user, this is one heck of a bookkeeping package.

I then created a new adobe ID through amazon and I was able to subscribe successfully. However, after a month and half, amazon abruptly cancelled the plan without my consent. Keep in mind that this plan offers Lightroom mobile - a killer feature that lets you sync low res version of photos to a sharable cloud. Canceling your plan at the wrong time may risk loosing all those photos.<br /><br />I subscribed to this plan during the prime day sale with a $40 amazon credit that was still due. I was able to get that credit (and another $10 inconvenience credit) after haggling with customer care execs, however, I do not want to renew the subscription through amazon. I went and subscribed to it through adobe. That is what I recommend everyone to do until amazon sorts this issue out.<br /><br />As far as the product is concerned, its pretty stellar.

Although Amazon is not the friendliest implementation or the most helpful support, their bleeding edge approach to trying new things is awesome... I just wish they devoted more time to improving the neat tools they created so competitors would not pass them by.  Making great capabilities available to its Amazon community is also a terrific business step, but some of those products lose their compelling story as competitors bypass their capabilities.  That is certainly the case with Amazon's Cloud Drive and Cloud Drive Desktop.<br /><br />On the plus side:<br />1.  The product makes use of Amazon's incredible infrastructure to deliver massive capabilities especially as far as the volume of data stored.<br />2.  That same infrastructure provides security, reliability and scalability that may not be surpassed except by other equally large companies like Google (ie Google Drive).<br />3.  With a Prime membership, you can store unlimited photographs, and 5GB of other files.  That is more than my Google Drive which limits me to 20GB total.<br /><br />On the bad side:<br />1.  The software is buggy.  For example, until this week many users could not download and install the Desktop product without getting an error something like &#34;Something went wrong and its not your fault.  Try again in a few minutes.&#34;  Really?  I am a technical guy and I did not know what to do with this.<br />2.  The apparent capabilities are lagging far behind the competition.  For example, the Desktop will allow you to load all of your directories to Cloud Drive; however, it does not allow you to specify the destination folder.  Again, this is an example of poor architectural planning for the products being offered.  Amazon's work around was to load all of the directories and then to select them and move them to the correct folder structure.  Really?  Is that an appropriate solution?  What if you are managing a huge number of images like a photographer or a studio?<br />3.  There is little effort made on significantly improving the product once it is released.  I encourage you to Google Amazon Cloud Drive reviews and see for yourself that these same problems were reported...  years ago!<br /><br />I love Amazon's innovation.  At one time I thought it was the most innovative company on the planet -- surpassing Google.  However, it seems to be moving so fast that it forgets to keep the quality of products up-to-speed.  It is just as important to continue improving innovations to keep ahead of competition as it is to find the next cool thing.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope this review was helpful and I welcome comments.  With warmest regards, I remain<br /><br />Very truly yours,<br />JDD",29/08/15

The truly terrible issue I had with this program was getting it downloaded from Microsoft's website. I have wasted at least 12 hours of my life trying to get this version installed. I have downloaded the program over 30 times on 3 different computers and with 3 different browsers. I have received checksum errors every time I clicked on the downloaded file. This is a known issue: https://www.google.com/#q=checksum+error+when+downloading+Microsoft+Office+for+Mac+2011. I was unaware of this when I purchased this version from Amazon. Also when I initially searched for Office for Mac on Amazon the option to get the program on disc was not displaying. This would have been my preferred option for a number of reasons, my present problems included. At least with no Internet connection I could have still installed the program.<br /><br />Finally last night I was able to resolve my issue. One of the tech support persons in the Philippines told me that Microsoft had issues with downloads via my ISP Mediacom. I actually thought of a solution that worked which I suggested to him. I had to leave the call after telling this person about my solution but was able to implement it later that evening. I had my son who lives in another city with a different ISP download the file into his or my Public Dropbox I forget which. I then dragged the disk image file onto my desktop and was able to install the program. It is worth noting that when he download the file it was the correct size hence no checksum error. The program installed without issue. I was also able to update the program through the update feature and the update downloaded using my ISP without issue. So I really don't know where the fault lies with respect to this issue. It is not as simple as it seems.<br /><br />One warning. The program included an icon for Outlook. I was curious because it was not listed as coming with the Home and Student edition. When I clicked on it and it asked for a product key. This appears to be an attempt to get you to purchase Outlook. Based on other posts I stayed away from the offer to connect to Office 365 and Microsoft Document Connection.

Don't Get The Paid Version,"First let me start off by saying that I downloaded this Antivirus and though, &#34;WOW! This looks amazing!&#34;, and then realized how ethically terrible AVAST is. I had the free version of the antivirus for 0-1 day before upgrading to a paid version. I buy and download Avast's, &#34;Grimefighter&#34;. I noticed that Grimefighter doesn't seem to be doing it's job so I call and am told my computer has been, &#34;compromised&#34;, that data from my computer would and could be, &#34;stolen&#34;. The person I spoke to, named Jose, begins to instill fear into me claiming that it was some form of, &#34;spyware&#34;, and it was a, &#34;corruption&#34;, of my, &#34;registry&#34;. I, like an idiot, fell for it. In the back of my mind, the logic began to swirl and reach it's way to my mouth, &#34;How is it possible for me to have 'spyware' and corruption of my 'registry' when I just finished building my PC last night??&#34; He then stuttered and stated that, &#34;AVAST offers a great 24/7 technical service that would have a technician ready to fix any issues you may encounter for a year called, &#34;Avast Total Support&#34;. The service costs like $179 and a one time fix would cost $119. I think you can see where this is going and what kind of company Avast truly is. The technician goes on and says, &#34;I'm here to help and I'm going to delete the viruses&#34;. I state, &#34;I have no viruses my computer was just built and turned on last night. It's an issue with my registry, malware&#34;. He states, &#34;It's all the same thing, viruses, malware, spyware and the issues stemming from your registry are because of the viruses&#34;. After about 4hrs of him manipulating my computer from his, he tells me, &#34;You're all set.&#34;. I was not at all, &#34;set&#34;! After about two days of back and forth's I lose it and demand a refund for fraudulent promises and lies. I receive my refund and invest my money in Kaspersky. I haven't had any issues as of yet. My experiences with Avast were terrible because they use these fear instilling tactics in order to con us out of our hard earned money; for a useless product. They lied about my computer having viruses and a corrupted registry, they lied saying the technician will fix everything, they sell faulty software (Grime fighter does NOT work as intended).",29/08/15

The website keeps kicking me back asking me for my correct email address and pass word.  I'm trying to create an account here.  It's ignoring the &#34;create account&#34; button and acting like I'm just trying to log into an existing account.  I purchased the download version and it looks like Amazon doesn't provide a way to get a refund.  Very frustrating.  Should have purchased this at Costco.  No problems with returns there. Update: Called Norton support (800-844-3362).  Got connected to what was an obvious off-shore boiler room. The tech informed me that I could get charged for the troubleshooting diagnosis depending on the problem.  After several attempts to get the tech to comprehend the problem, I ended the call. The download version is on a deal-of-the-day sale ($27.99) today.  Don't waste your time. Update 2: Several hours later, I was able to register as a new customer and then downloaded the software without issue. There is an annoying pop-up you will inherit if you accept the recommended load configuration. I leveraged the Control Panel to find and get rid of it.  As mentioned, support was a nightmare (see below) so I didn't call them again.  However, I feel compelled to upgrade the product  to 3 stars.  It is working, Norton did respond to this posting, and and the price was right.  The issue I was having with the website registration process may have been due to an overwhelming response to the sale.  I suspect the Norton support staff was equally overwhelmed. Update3: To be fair, it now looks like I was not talking to Norton Support.  After they fixed their website, I was able to create an account and get the correct Norton Support phone number.   Perhaps if I ordered the key card version a support phone number would have been on it.  I went back and checked all emails & links received from Both Amazon & Norton.  Nowhere can I find a support phone number.  This is kind of a catch 22 if you order the downloaded version as I did.  It puts you in search mode which opens traps like the won I walked into.

And while there appears to be a process to correct your number of shares, it will not update your account after you make those corrections.  They just sit there in a &#34;placeholder&#34; entry, enticing you to spend even more time trying to figure out how to get the place holder to actually adjust your balances.<br /><br />You work with it over and over, thinking if you just figure out something it will all fall in place and make sense, but no.  It doesn't.  It doesn't work.

I have subscribed to the pro version for the last 2 years.<br />Advanced System is now ASC 8 not 7.<br />Advanced System Care Pro (or the free version) is a stand alone program. But there are also downloadable (free) add ons that are useful to excellent. These add ons are downloadable through ASC.<br />Some observations I will share.<br />(1) Considering the entire program and all the bits and pieces its a great program with some serious reservations.<br />Its a great program for the everyday computer user to clean up the computer in one step/operation.<br />It does do a great job cleaning up system files. Never had an issue causing system problems from using it.<br />But my reservations:<br />(1) It seems that iObit is always trying to add programs. Programs like their Malware fighter, which I find next to worthless as compared to Malwarebytes. You have to be careful as these programs will slip on to the computer. Now these programs are NOT bad per say and can be very helpful. Driver Booster is an example of an outstanding add on  program  to update all your drivers. I highly recommend this program.<br />(2)  But the issue I have is that some of these programs  want to run in the background. There is no real need for this. It will just slow down the computer, especially if you are doing intensive demands on it. The faster the processer/ more Ram  the less of a problem this is.<br />You will need to turn these programs off under settings on each of them, You have to uncheck &#34;load at system start up&#34; so they do not boot up initially. You will also have to turn them off after use. Especially if you do not reboot your computer daily.<br /><br />I would have no problem with awarding 5 stars if these 2 issues were addressed by iObit.<br />(1) Do not run on start up is the default settings. The user can turn on if they choose.<br />  Actually Norton 360 and Malwarebytes are the only programs that I run in the background.<br />(2) Stop the add on programs without full disclosure, such as a pop up, asking the customer if they want to add this program to their computer.<br />  Saying downloading is not enough.  They can always be deleted thru  add/ remove programs or programs and features (windows 10).<br /> These programs running in the background, especially all the add on programs can slow your computer down.<br /><br />That said I do like ASC 8 a lot. But It does take some persistence to stay on top of these two issues. A novice might have problems with these items.  If you land up with all these add ons running in the background it could slow things down.",28/08/15

Overall, the cabinet itself is great and fits my needs perfectly. It has plenty of storage room, is very easy to assemble, and has a beautiful gloss black finish. As far as security, it is just as the title states, a security cabinet. While secure enough to keep kids out or keep an &#34;honest man&#34; honest, it won't however slowdown a determined &#34;crack-head&#34;! If you need something to suit those needs then you should look into an actual safe. As other reviewers have stated, the plastic barrel standoffs are mounted a bit high in the cabinet for any carbine style rifle but this is easy to correct for any handyman.<br /><br />Now onto the reason behind my 3 star rating (Stack-On, PAY ATTENTION)... I did a lot of research on this cabinet via other websites to see end user reviews on not only this cabinet but also on other models. Those sites included Amazon, Home Depot, Lowes, and of course Google. On every site that I visited the majority of all complaints that I viewed were from SHIPPING DAMAGE! I figured people were just receiving cabinets damaged by your average adolescent package handler or forklift operator... That is until I received mine! After it arrived I looked the exterior packaging over and it was in perfect condition. No tears, rips, or even obvious wrinkles in the cardboard. Once the flimsy packaging was removed it was a whole different story. The upper right front facing corner of mine was crushed, just above the right hand door. I was able to straighten it to some extent but it is still obvious and I am unhappy with that aspect as it is highly visible. After looking at how they were packed from the manufacturer I now understand what others are complaining about. Stack-On... THE PACKAGING IS NOTHING SHORT OF INADEQUATE TO PREVENT EVEN THE SLIGHTEST DAMAGE OCCURRENCE! To anyone thinking of purchasing a cabinet....The cabinets are great when used for their intended purpose but, make sureyou thoroughly check it with the delivery driver present! Chances are it will be damaged regardless of how good the exterior cardboard looks! As for me.. If I can't see it in a store before purchasing... I won't be ordering another one!",19/11/14

I was worried they may be flat like other brands I have purchased but the pouch and cardboard box they were shipped in really protected them. The colors are bright are perfect to match a little girl's wardrobe. I love how they can be used in casual or dressy outfits. The satin flowers aren't just a one piece pressed flower, it is several small pleats that give it more volume and depth. We have tried both single bows as well as making combinations with them. The clips are alligator style clips that hold well in my daughter's fine hair. They do not seem to poke her head or pull her hair.

I have seen the price on these clones anywhere form $41 to $100 for the entire unit.<br /><br />So I would really check out the costs to make sure your not paying top dollar for your device.<br />What I like about it:<br />It's built very well and seems like it could survive a accidental drop<br />It has a huge tank that's simple to fill once you check out a youtube video to learn how if your new to these devices.<br />Huge powerful battery, with 4 different output voltages that allow larger hits if that what you want.<br />Charges fully in about 4 hours.<br />Does not leak any juice into your mouth which really is gross!<br />Seems like it will last a long time with a replaceable battery.<br />Has a optional LED flashlight that can be added to the battery for a very powerful flashlight.<br />Can add any 510 thread tank!<br />Has a two color battery power indicator that cheaper vaps do not have. This one will light up white with a full charge and light up blue when the charge is in the 30% left range. (Great feature that I have not seen on my friends $35 unit)<br />On/Off is as simple as pushing the power button 5 times within two seconds and it works well.<br /><br />Seeing that this is my first purchase of a vap device that I use for nicotine addiction I'm smoking less real cigs from 2 packs a day down to one.<br /><br />This for me is going to hopefully help me quit smoking all together. However, in the mean time this will give me the hand to mouth addiction in a way that does not harm my lungs like real smoke will.<br /><br />If you want a good vapor pen this is a really good one and my best friend who has bought several of these is now buying this one based on how great it is. So the experience I lack is made up with my friends and he thinks this is a excellent vapor device and will be buying one very soon.",25/08/15

I discovered Zuke's Skinny Bakes while searching for vegan dog treats. The flavor that I purchased was Pumpkin, and I like the ingredients for the most part. The ingredients are as follows: Oatmeal, Pearled Barley, Rice Bran, Pumpkin, Sweet Potatoes, Carrots, Potatoes, Pea Fiber, Cane Molasses, Oil Blend [Canola oil, Sunflower oil, Olive oil], Natural Flavor, Rosemary Extract and Mixed Tocopherols [a preservative]. I appreciate that there is no added wheat, corn, soy, salt, or dyes in these treats, and that they are made in the USA. I paid $5.99 for a 12oz. bag which supposedly contains 140+ treats, so in my opinion, this is a good deal. I believe my dog would rate the taste of these as a 2/5,  when he's given a choice between these treats and treats containing meat, he always eats the other treats first. Even though they're definitely not his favorite, he still does eat them eventually. Since the texture is so dry, dipping them in water might make them a little bit more appealing. The biscuits do smell good, and I tried one to see what they taste like. In my opinion they're not great, but they're not bad either, predominantly bland flavor with a little bit of sweetness. I wouldn't eat them as a snack. The size of the biscuits is fine for my medium sized dog, and if you're feeding a smaller dog the biscuit breaks in half easily, so the treats shouldn't be too big for tiny breeds to enjoy.Mixed Tocopherols [a preservative].

My dog thinks they taste okay, however when he's given a choice between these treats and treats containing meat, he always eats the other treats first. Even though they're definitely not his favorite, he still does eat them eventually and I feel much better feeding him Zuke's Skinny Bakes versus Purina Beggin' Strips or Pup-Peroni. The biscuits do smell good, and I tried one to see what they taste like. In my opinion they're not great, but they're not bad either, predominantly bland flavor with a little bit of sweetness from the pumpkin, sweet potato and molasses. I wouldn't eat them as a snack or anything. The size of the biscuits is fine for my medium sized dog, and if you're feeding a smaller dog the biscuit breaks in half easily, so the treats shouldn't be too big for tiny breeds to enjoy. If you don't care about Zuke's association with NestlÃ© / Purina, I still recommend these, as the ingredients are better than most mainstream dog treats. However, I will be searching for a new brand.",31/08/15

I read the other reviews and agree it is too tall for my 10 gallon tank to be able to use holding it straight up. You would have to keep it on a slant, but that wasn't working for me. Instead I did not use the extender tube. I removed that completely, both parts and put the gravel vacuum part on the end directly. Since it doesn't lock in that way, I took a small rubber band and looped it around one of the slots on the gravel vacuum piece and up over the elbow piece. Worked perfect holding it straight up that way!!! I also use a small rubber band to hold the filter bag on, just in case it falls off in the tank.

(It was basically a sterilite bin with a hole cut into the top.) My old litter box worked great at stopping litter trackage and spillage, but its enclosed nature allowed my young male to trap my old female inside, and it has begun to stress her significantly. (He likes to play--she does not.)<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Two Meows just didn't live up to my expectations, based off of product descriptions and reviews. I bought it as well as a little catching mat by the same company; despite rave reviews saying it trapped litter marvelously, my living room was still coated in a near-constant sheen of gravel. I had to sweep daily just to try and keep it under control. (Oh, and my cats managed to tear a split into the mat about 1/3rd its total length.)<br /><br />Ultimately, I switched to pellet litter instead of clay litter, which has fixed the tracking issue, but the whole point of the Two Meows was to be able to use clumping litter without all the tracking.<br /><br />So here's where I try to give credit where credit is due:<br /><br />The Two Meows is probably the best open-pan box I've seen in terms of litter spillage. Take that however you will.<br /><br />My male is pretty rambunctious. (He will even playcin the litter.) I think we might have had better success with keeping the litter in the pan if it was just my lackadaisical female using it. If your cat is old or very calm, this box might work better for you than it did for me. I don't recommend it to anyone with very hyperactive cats, because the walls and grate just won't be enough.<br /><br />I live in a small apartment, so a little litter tracking goes a long way. If you have a large home or a &#34;cat room&#34; the amount of spillage I experienced might be comparatively insignificant.<br /><br />I wouldn't actively discourage anyone from buying this box, but be aware that, depending on you, your home, and your cats, it just might not live up to the reviews.",31/08/15

This leash is lightweight, comfortable, and durable... and if your dog does manage to somehow destroy it, Lupine will replace it for you. The material is a lot lighter and easier on the hands than your typical pet-store nylon leash, and the snap is very smooth and easy going on and off, with the swivel working nicely to keep the leash from twisting too much. It's also not so heavy that it drags on the collar just by being attached. The handle is padded without being heavy. If it gets dirty, muddy, or covered in slobber, a bit of water will get it clean very easily, and unlike leather it doesn't require any conditioning. I've been using this for several weeks and waiting to find something about it that I don't like, but there's nothing. I love it. I'd give it more than five stars if I could.

I'm out over $70 :(,"At the beginning of this summer, after some online research of safety, effeciacy, product reviews and the testimony of at least one friend who uses this product on her dog, I made the decision to invest in this collar. I do mean &#34;invest&#34; as it was a hrad financial decison considering how ridiculously expensive it is. I paid $69 plus tax for the collar at my vet's office. I bought it for my 94 pound German Shepherd who does not like to have the topical drops applied. After a month I noticed fleas on my dog and mentioned it to one of  the vet techs. She said I probably needed to pull the collar tighter. She said something to the effect of, &#34;You should only be able to slip one finger under the collar. It needs to be tight enough to work.&#34; I went home and tightened the collar to what seemed to me to be uncomfortably tight for any dog. I waited several days and she still scratched throughout the night and day, which I confirmed were fleas. I didn't see any ticks. For the cost of this collar, it should grow arms and pick every last flea off the dog wearing it. Sarcastically speaking, I expected to see absolutely no fleas all summer and was highly disappointed with the amount of fleas and discomfort my dog had to go through. The vet of course would not refund any portion of my money and referred me to the Serest company. I will not buy this product again, nor will I recommend it to anyone. I realize my dog may be an isolated case, but I was not impressed with this product and feel quite ripped off for $70!",31/08/15

My toes naturally spread out to the point where my wife says I could fit another toe in between the ones I have.  I had researched different ways to lace up shoes to make them feel wider and it worked for a while until my foot would begin to blow out the sides of the shoes.  now insert the Altra One2.  This is the most comfortable running shoe I have ever worn!!!  I have had Asics, Nike, Addidas, Zoot, etc.  This one takes the win easily.  I was previously trading off running in Nike Free 3.0 and the Zoot Ultra Kiawe Race.  I was getting ready to start a marathon training plan for this season and decided I needed a new pair of shoes.  I bought these based on all the other reviews stating how wide the toe box is and the fact they are zero drop!  First pair i bought was a size 10 as that is what I wore in the Nike Free and Zoot Kiawe Race.  The Altras were a little too small, returned for a 10.5.  PERFECT FIT!  I have done multiple long runs in these shoes including speed and tempo work.  Average weekly miles in these shoes is about 30 miles.  They have been great so far!

In fact I used some of the smallest grommets and got them in place easily.<br /><br />INSTALLATION TIP: Use Dawn Dish Soap to lubricate the hole you plan on inserting the grommet in.

It's primary use was to drill holes into aluminum plate and bar stock. Unfortunately I can't list any of the specs for this drill press but I will say that I can't recommend purchasing it. The main reason was that the press seemed underpowered. On larger diameter holes (1/2&#34;+) even with heavy lubrication, the press would get stuck and stop. I also got the impression that while the construction of this press was sturdy, the parts used were not of the best quality. I don't think it would last under heavy use. It worked well for holes under 1/2&#34; in aluminum. I rarely used the laser sight but the times I did use it I found it was accurate.

I did suspect that would be the case before even purchasing this item so it was not a surprise to me, but I could see it frustrating a buyer who goes with this model due to the on board dust collection feature.<br /><br />The price, the hard case, and the Bosch name were the main reason why I made this purchase. If a hard case is not a big factor then I would recommend going with the least expensive orbital sander you can find since they all seem to do a great job for their intended purpose without an appreciable difference in build quality or ease of use.",31/08/15

Designed to mount on different brands of table saws. I mounted this on an older Sears Craftsman table saw.<br />Outer 2 mounting holes (large slots) are shaped differently than just a round hole as indicated on website drawing. The Craftsman uses the smaller of the provided hardware (5/16&#34;). The 5/16&#34; hardware barely engage these large slots (0.6&#34; x 1&#34;) and the cast iron needs more support than standard grade round washers. I contacted Rockler (they bought Bench Dog) and was provided additional heavy rectangular washers to use on these outer slots.<br />The rip fence mounting holes are lower than those on the Craftsman. I had to drill holes in the ProMax to attached my rip fence rails. The rails provide additional support for the ProMax.<br />Router plate leveling screws are coarse thread so leveling was a challenge.<br />I downgraded my rating to a &#34;4&#34; because of the unexpected oversize slots (and not providing additional heavy washers) and the rip fence mounting holes.,31/08/15

The design borrows from the &#34;Perfect Shot&#34;, giving a realistic pistol grip feel, and borrows the design of the GonCon 3 Controller by adding a nunchuck holder for your nunchuck adapter. I love this little device as you you have everything you need right on the gun and can detach the nunchuck accessory/addon at any time. One main reason why i love this accessory is because I play a lot of rail shooters for the wii, mainly Ghost Squad. Apparently the people who ported the arcade game to the wii didn't have their heads on right as if you use the wii zapper accessory your trigger finger will be your left hand instead of your right with your secondary fire button being your right trigger finger. This upset me to know and and I thought that if all zapper games were like this, then there's gonna be a problem. I've looked at many pistol style accessories for the wii mote but the problem with those is that if you need to do something other than pull the trigger like in ghost squad, you'll have to reach up and around the barrel to push the buttons with your other hand. This was not only annoying but it also broke immersion which is something i'm big on.<br /><br />So how does this accessory fair? Well when I first got it I was finding it difficult to put together as mine didn't come with instructions, however after playing around with it I figured out how to set it all up. the way it's designed is that you'll have to flip up the rear site that is connected to a long plastic piece that runs down along the back of the grip and slip in the wiimote on top, once it's seated you can close the gun and have fun. if you wish to attach the nunchuck you'll have to connect the addon, put the nunchuck in the carry case and open up the rear sight again. At the very base of the handle you can see where the rear sight connect you can easily pull that whole piece out so that you can run the nunchuck cable all the way up the back of the handle and connect to the wiimote. Once you do that, snap the plastic piece back into place and close the rear sight and you're set. The power is now at your fingertips!<br /><br />The trigger responds well however the nunchuck add on feels a bit flimsy like it could break if gripped or jerks too hard or even dropped. Everything feels very similar to the GunCon 3 controller so if you've used that before, this will be a much welcomed accessory. All in all this is by far one of the better wiimote guns I've used and would greatly recommend it!",31/08/15

One my other AV cable the left and right audio channels are correctly wired to their respective pins resulting in much better sound.

In his place, the evil vizier Jaffar takes control and plans to marry the Princess and kill the Sultan should he dare to return. However the Princess despises Jaffar and has fallen in love with a mysterious traveler. Knowing this young man will get in his way, Jaffar has him arrested and thrown into the deepest dungeon in the palace. He then gives the Princess an ultimatum, either marry Jaffar or die within the hour. Meanwhile, the young man has broken his bonds and must now race to the top of the palace to free the Princess before time runs out.<br /><br />Prince of Persia was ported to numerous other computers and consoles before this version, and while there are some distinguishing features, little has changed, however this is not necessarily a bad thing as Prince of Persia was and remains a fantastic platforming experience. Having been one of the first true attempts at realistic platforming, the controls definitely take considerable time to get used to. The game has you navigate a series of mazes with death traps and swordsmen at nearly every corner. The game places an emphasis on caution as running head on into any problem is a fast way to die. Despite this focus on taking things slowly, the ever present countdown is a constant reminder that you have to get moving. It is also important to note that, while you can retry a level as much as you want, starting over a level after death does not restart the countdown. Although the control may seem rough and difficult when you first play the game, after you are used to how the character moves and interacts with his surroundings the game becomes very fun.<br /><br />Most versions of this game tend to be the same, but there are a few that offer unique features. This version has some additions that add to the value and one that may turn some off. The key feature here is unique graphics. Instead of simply being a port of the Genesis version's graphics, the Sega CD version has it's own designs for the player and enemy sprites, as well as new variations on the backgrounds. however, although it's a nice touch, the graphics aren't quite as good as the Genesis version or as varied as the SNES version, which is a little disappointing for the Sega CD. Next is a feature very few versions of the game included, a full soundtrack. However, it is not very extensive. There are two tracks you will hear primarily throughout the game with a few fanfares here and there, but besides them there are a some tracks for the menus and cut scenes. And that brings us to the cut scenes. At the opening and ending of the game are cut scenes that tell the story. However, they have very little in the way of animation and the voice acting is what you'd expect from early nineties anime dubs. The one other feature that puts this version above the other console ports is the ability to save your game. Almost every console version requires passwords to keep your progress, but this version allows you to use the system's internal memory to save at the start of each level. This will allow you to shave off some time and beat the game as fast as you can.<br /><br />Overall, the package is fairly solid. It's not necessarily the preferred version of Prince of Persia, but it has enough to stand out among the numerous ports. If you have a Sega CD ans want to expand your collection a bit, it's worth getting.to the value and one that may turn some off. The key feature here is unique graphics.

Add in the Erin and Kirk segments that are semi-repetitive but still add a nice touch which the 2013 versions didn't have and I am liking this 2011 Road to Glory version the best of all the NCAA's I've played out of 05, 06, 08, and 13.

I knew this however when purchasing the item from other reviewers so I bumped my review up from a 3 to a 4. My real reason for purchasing this item over others was that I already had the same model charging station for my PS4 (and love it!). As for the xbox one model, the only thing holding your controller on the base is gravity. And as we all know, sometimes gravity can be a finicky beast. Also the batteries supplied do not contain as much of a charge as the official rechargeable batteries from Microsoft.<br /><br />All in all however, the device serves its purpose fine so long as you recognize it's faults. I have placed mine in an area that the controllers are not likely to get knocked off the charger but yet it's close enough for me to grab a spare controller if I need one. The indicator lights on the charge station are also nice.",30/08/15

But as far as saving space goes this thing is great. The system doesn't really lock into place, but so long as you don't fall into your tv stand (or wherever you keep your PS4) you should be okay. The fan is a little bit noisy if you're sitting in a quiet room, but if you're mid game or watching something on your Playstation it's not really that noticeable. However, they kindly help you with any issues you might have with that by adding a stop button that basically toggles the fans on and off.

The art in general is very nice and the artbook  has some great images in it. The soundtrack is good, nowhere near one of my favourites, but definitely good.<br />If I had one gripe with the game it's that the boss fights that Iv'e faced at the point of writing this are tedious, without anything to keep the player interested in the fight while they slog through the large amount of health and possible multiple forms the bosses have.<br /><br />For anyone without an American PS4, be aware that the DLC may not work for you, it didn't work on my Irish console so just keep that in mind.<br /><br />As far as packaging and delivery go, the game arrived earlier than was expected, fully packaged and with everything listed on the page, more than satisfactory.",30/08/15

Like Heavy Rain before it, Until Dawn is a unique experience that I'd recommend anyone give a try. It's a healthy 10-12 hour length to complete, but it's filled with replayability as you can make new decisions that dramatically alter the narrative. Even if you aren't a huge horror fan, I say still give it a shot. From the atmospheric graphics and sound, to the multiple character driven narrative, I think the developer nailed what they set out to achieve.",30/08/15

Not a bid deal, you can still play for many hours (I'd say at least 6 on a full charge, maybe longer, I never counted).  Other than that, it looks, feels and functions just like the real thing and is identical in every way except it says &#34;P3&#34; on the center button instead of the official PS3 logo.  The joysticks have a nice rubber grip too like the real controller.  My 3 year old loves it and will only play with this controller now.  He has used it daily for about a week playing various LEGO games with no issues at all.  I don't know if the rumble/vibrate function works or not, as I have only used the controller myself very briefly, but for this price who cares.<br /><br />Another thing to note is that the controller will turn off automatically if you don't use it after a certain (and fairly short) period of time.  For example, if you are watching a movie on Netflix or something where you wouldn't be pushing buttons on the controller it will turn off, which is kind of annoying because you need to push the ps3 button to turn it back on before you can pause the movie, but overall this is a probably a good feature because it saves battery life and you can just fall asleep or walk away and it will turn off on its own.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this if you need an extra controller.  It is not worth paying over 3 times the price for an official Sony controller when the only real difference seems to be a longer battery life.  I was skeptical about buying a generic controller, but this one from USPRO works great so far and I'm very pleased.",30/08/15

I used to watch it at my grandma's house and could only ever remember the burping scene in the barn. I watched it recently, thanks to the wonder of the internet, and I have to say it is dreadful. The story is practically non existent, the characters behave stupidly, the production is cheap, and it is so dullllll.<br /><br />The movie has Fritz, who is a magical being, walking around in our world. Suddenly he loses his magic gold dust pouch and some hunter finds it. Fritz needs to get it back or the world is doomed. Why is it doomed? What does the dust actually do? Who knows. The movie never explains it. Fritz just says &#34;it makes men greedy for power&#34;. So Fritz bumbles along with some local kids for almost 45 MINUTES before figuring out he can use the last bit of his magic to take him back to the Great Land of Small. WOW, I can't believe this movie kept me amused as a kid. Its so so so boring. When you finally get to see the magical land, you are presented with cheap sets and poor costumes. Everything looks pathetic.<br /><br />The last 10 minutes don't make any sense. So the hunter guy with the gold dust, runs up to the top of a hill and starts summoning lightening with the dust. Ok, finally something crazy is going to happen. He will awaken a monster or something...nope, he accidentally knocks over his daughter and then begs everyone to forgive him. He gives the dust back to Fritz and the movie ends. What? That's it? What a waste of time.<br /><br />There are moments where it looks like peoples voices were dubbed over. I don't know if they couldn't adequately pick up audio on location and re-dubbed in studio, or if the people honestly couldn't speak English like a godzilla movie. It was baffling at times how bad the sync up was. The camera often lingers too long on peoples faces after a line is spoken and it looks awkward. The editing should have been tighten up. There are other moments where you will see background characters walking about with no purpose. Edit around that, no one cares, just move the action along.<br /><br />The only mildly amusing point of this movie is that a lot of lines are delivered so terribly you will crack up. People really ham up their acting, but it comes across so silly. Beyond that, the movie is a disgrace.<br /><br />Don't recommend. Remember it fondly.",21/08/15

No, really.<br /><br />I am generously giving this film two stars as it will appease some young children's desire for entertainment, but it's a painful ordeal for anyone over the age of six or so. It is kid-friendly as there's no language, inappropriate situational issues, or real scares in the film, which also helped it drag out the second star. True lovers of campy films may also relish in the amazing overacting, terrible special effects, and ludicrous plot; while I normally count myself in that group, this one severely tested my will. I can't imagine why the film never made it to DVD.<br /><br />The film starts off with the first of many interesting directorial choices from Bob Keen, superimposing on the credits still images of bigfoot and doughnuts. Meat Loaf is Big Jake Grizzly, the world's greatest hunter, assisted by his portly dumb sidekick Blubber (Rick Howland). They find a yeti to fulfill their contract to Wesley Sturgeon (Jeff Moser), an insufferable brat whose father is an ultra-rich guy from New York City. I'm going to give Moser the nod for best actor in the film, because his portrayal of a terrible, horrible, awful spoiled child is extremely convincing. Meat Loaf finds the animatronic yeti: surprisingly, it's around two feet tall, though it does have disproportionately large feet. The yeti is cute in a demonically-possessed toy sort of way, and in an effort to elude Loaf, he wriggles into the backpack of a mullet-headed recreational hiker, Dave Bristow (Jim Gordon) in the Himalayas, who happens to be from Albany. Somehow doofy Dave brings the yeti home in his backpack without noticing after a 30 hour journey, where his daughter Amy (Chantallese Kent) discovers it and quickly adopts him as her new best friend. It turns out that yetis don't like the warm temperatures of New York in the winter, which ultimately results in Hank, as the yeti is now named, getting the vapors and getting an ice bath in the kitchen sink. May I at this point take a moment to interject that until you have seen this movie, you have no idea how bad acting can be (although &#34;Raiders of the Lost Shark&#34; gives it a run for its money).<br /><br />Despite Dave's best friend being a cop, they won't prosecute Meat Loaf for, among other things, assault, kidnapping, and breaking and entering because the yeti was imported without a permit. (Ponder.) After Loaf steals the yeti and takes it to the Sturgeon mansion for psychopathic Wesley to torment, Amy takes the bus there in hot pursuit. The parents follow on a train because their car broke down. (Why? How does any of this help the plot?) While Wesley shoots ping pong balls at Hank, Dave impersonates an immigration official (and the felonies just keep on coming...), giving his name as (I am sorry to report this) Harry Callahan, and using the worst New York accent I've ever heard. There's a fracas in the city which peaks with the yeti skateboarding, followed by an extremely complicated and oddly time-critical plotpoint involving a train timetable (why do they have to be on that specific train?) Before long Dave, his wife Kate (Leigh Lewis, whose British accent made me want to scream &#34;Shut up!&#34; repeatedly; it really is nails on a blackboard), and Amy are at their cabin hiding out because the police won't protect them from dangerous felons who are hot in pursuit. Amy and Hank then go sledding.<br /><br />Needless to say the good guys are imperiled and it's all up to Amy and Hank to figure out how to defeat Loaf and company. Any guesses who wins? Apparently neither Grizzly nor Dave understands the Castle Doctrine, and the adults, though heavily armed, allow themselves to be taken hostage, though they do hit Loaf with the gun rather than shoot him. (Right.) After the bad guys are dealt with (Oh, the humanity!) Dave calls his cop buddy and arranges to rendezvouswith him so he can bring them their passports because, naturally, they are all going to fly to Kathmandu to return the yeti to the wild. I will not even attempt to explain the ensuing chase or altercation in the JFK airport (Please tell me American Airlines didn't pay for product placement here!) I won't explain it because I don't even understand it. Let's just say that Blubber does something so out of left field that nobody could predict it, though the image of Hank in the x-ray machine amused me. I will just mention that the cop won't protect them from dangerous thugs, but he will assist them in fleeing the country with an illegal yeti. Oh, never mind. They return Hank to the wild and there's a heartbreaking scene followed by Hank's reunion with his kin which made me go &#34;Awwwwwwwwwwww!&#34; That was the sound of me retching.with him so he can bring them their passports because, naturally, they are all going to fly to Kathmandu to return the yeti to the wild. I will not even attempt to explain the ensuing chase or altercation in the JFK airport (Please tell me American Airlines didn't pay for product placement here!)

I will just mention that the cop won't protect them from dangerous thugs, but he will assist them in fleeing the country with an illegal yeti. Oh, never mind. They return Hank to the wild and there's a heartbreaking scene followed by Hank's reunion with his kin which made me go &#34;Awwwwwwwwwwww!&#34; That was the sound of me retching.",19/08/15

I personally LOVE LOVE LOVE these videos and my kids loved them when they were young, but they are in their 20s now, so I guess these are outdated.  My grandkids don't really enjoy them, but they have access to all the cable channels, so of course they don't like these story book videos.  Each one of these in the series has 3 stories.  The animation is just pictures that they sort of tilt around to make them look like they're moving, so kind of cheesy I guess.  I just liked the stories, and they went well with all my kids Little Golden Books.  A lost art these days, reading to kids and nice, innocent videos that don't have cartoon characters with super powers, kids with attitudes towards their parents, magical and mystical junk, and too much over-stimulation.  No wonder so many kids have ADD.  But I digress.  I'm 55, my kids are grown, and I love these.  Kids might not like them, so that's the only reason I gave it four stars.  I still love them.  The stories themselves are adorable, classic stories that have stood the test of time.  Who doesn't like The Pokey Little Puppy, Peter Rabbit, The Little Red Hen, and Scuffy the Tugboat?  My favorite stories in the Little Golden Video Series are these are Polly's Pet (not on this particular video), and What Was That? (also not on this video). My favorite story on this particular one is Pokey Puppy, but the Sailor Dog is adorable too.  We had planned to convert to DVD, but I guess we won't now.",19/08/15

And while it can be enjoyed in a vacuum, the true power of the piece is watching these people through the arc of their whole lives.  Watching one piece out of that context can't have quite the same power.  This is a case where the sum is greater than the parts, even if the parts are all pretty terrific.<br /><br />In terms of the series as a whole (which I strongly suggest you seek out) - while I could quibble, wishing for a bit more depth here and there (especially with the women, where there's a bit too much emphasis on love and marriage at the expense of all else), it's really an astounding, moving, frightening and uplifting document. There's no way to watch this remarkable series of films without reflecting deeply on one's own life, and how you have changed (and stayed the same) over your own lifetime.<br /><br />While Michael Aped deserves every bit of credit he's received for this amazing piece of cultural anthropology, it's important to note that the first film, 7 Up,was actually directed by Paul Almond, and Apted was a that point a researcher for the project.",18/08/15

Two men play chess. Bogie gets bad news about his father. His wife is an actress too. Bogart looks for work, he plays in â€œThe Petrified Forestâ€ on stage, then in the movie version. Bogie drinks, He plays the â€œtough guyâ€ off screen. He meets Mayo at a party. Unpredictable? They drink together. â€œâ€Check the coil.â€ They marry. Later Bogie plays in a remake of â€œThe Maltese Falconâ€ after others turn it down. â€œThe Battling Bogartsâ€? Then he plays in â€œCasablancaâ€. He is a Hollywood star now. In the next movie his co-star is a fashion model. They rehears the part and develop an attraction. The arguments with Mayo continue. [Jealousy on her part?] Bogart wants a divorce, Mayo only wants him.  After the movie is finished Bogieâ€™s love grows. Will they marry and have children? Their movie is a hit! Mayo wants him to come home, she needs him. â€œI owe her that muchâ€ he says. They remember their trips to entertain the troops during the war. Bogie sees another sailboat and wants it next. But Mayo continues to drink, so does the fighting. Now he has a new sailboat and a new wife. Louella Parsons interviews them. Bogie defends the Bill or Rights against the House Un-American Committee. At home Lauren wants a new stove. A bigger house? Bogie lives within his income. They have a little boy. Bogie continues to star in hit movies. â€œYou only get as much as you give.â€ Lauren has a surprise for him. Lauren goes to a political rally in San Francisco.  A medical condition results in bad news: cancer in the esophagus. [Smoking and drinking?] Bogie leaves for the hospital. The operation takes longer than predicted, there is a long convalescence. Bogie owns an Oldsmobile [a mid-range automobile not a luxury brand]. Bogie plays chess with Mike, a friend. Life goes on. Lauren doesnâ€™t want to go anywhere without Bogie. Scrambled eggs and bacon for breakfast. The doctor visits; â€œno improvementsâ€. He is allowed one visitor a day. The doctor advises against going outside in the cold and wind, a chance of pneumonia. He takes his son sailing on the ocean, then gives young Stephen a family heirloom. There is a call on the ship-to-shore telephone. â€œOver and out.â€  The family name is of Dutch origin. The Bogardus family were big landowners in New Jersey. The city of Bogota was renamed from Bogardus (or so I read). Bogart joined the Navy in WW I (as did John Dillinger). â€œThe Petrified Forestâ€ made him famous, other roles continues. [â€œHigh Sierraâ€ in 1941 had a better story than â€œThe Maltese Falconâ€, a copy of the 1931 version (see them yourself). His following movies were popular, he played an ordinary man who worked for justice. Most of his movies were in monochrome and are not shown on television today (like the Westerns from the 1930s and 1940s). A biography will tell you more than a two hour movie.",18/08/15

I'll tell you why. I've already got the entire series on DVD, but I still wanted this tape because of the great alternate intro included on it that was not included on the DVD releases. When the show first started it was just called &#34;Batman&#34;, but during the last ten episodes, they renamed the show &#34;The Adventures of Batman & Robin&#34; with a new title sequence and theme song. This title sequence was included on the ten episodes on the DVDs, but during repeats of older episodes they included yet another title sequence with the title of &#34;The Adventures of Batman & Robin&#34; with the original theme music which I liked even better. But that intro was only included in the repeats and these VHS releases. And in my opinion, that is enough for me to buy this VHS tape. Plus the episodes on this release are really good.<br /><br />First in &#34;House and Garden&#34;, Poison Ivy has been released from Arkham Asylum apparently rehabilitated and has settled down with a family. But when wealthy bachelors are poisoned and robbed in ways that mirror Ivy's old tactics, Batman and Robin suspect she's up to her old tricks. But is she the real culprit? This one has a great story in it, lots of mystery and plot twists, and some nice action scenes.<br /><br />Next in &#34;Eternal Youth&#34;, Bruce Wayne along with a lot of other wealthy industrialists have been invited to a free weekend at the Enternal Youth Spa. Bruce decides not to go and gives his free invitation to Alfred and his lady friend Maggie. But when they don't return along with the other &#34;guests&#34;, Batman decides to investigate and uncovers a sinister plot hatched by Poison Ivy... a plot that may mean the end of Bruce's trusted friend and butler! A good plot with a good mystery in it and a great action-packed ending.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!",18/08/15

I first saw this on PBS in 1984 and later taped it on VHS. It needs to be on DVD.  Narrated perfectly by the great Jason Robards,it shows how our world was poised between The Great Depression & WWII. The '39 New York World's Fair was set to show us the &#34;positive&#34; side of the future, pull us out of the doldrums of the Depression and zoom us into &#34;The World Of Tomorrow&#34;...which would hold a bright future for every man, woman, and, child.  Some of the rarest, early colour photography was researched & unearthed for this unique presentation. Its features include new cities planned to accomodate its inhabitants with plenty of clean, airy, space; super highways so we could travel routes that were uncongested; that new fangled invention &#34;television&#34; that would replace the radio in our living rooms; new appliances that would take the drudgery out of housework;a telephone with a video screen attached so that you could see the person you were talking to...and many, many other ways that the future would be one that we could eagerly look forward to.  BUT, by the time the Fair began, Hitler's rise to power, and his marching into Poland, and treading on every area he could enter, had started the wheels-in-motion to bring the World into a new World War...which would be worse than WWI. SO, by 1940 when the Fair's head, Grover Whalen, was replaced, the U.S.A., and the rest of the World was on edge...and by the Fall of 1940 the NYWF would close on a somber note.  &#34;The World Of Tomorrow&#34; is truly a must see documentary for those who are old enough to remember that early time period, for those of us who grew up in the waning year's of WWII, and for those who don't fit into either of those catagories but want to learn how this important piece of history impacted the world we live in today.

And while it can be enjoyed in a vacuum, the true power of the piece is watching these people through the arc of their whole lives.  Watching one piece out of that context can't have quite the same power.  This is a case where the sum is greater than the parts, even if the parts are all pretty terrific.<br /><br />In terms of the series as a whole (which I strongly suggest you seek out) - while I could quibble, wishing for a bit more depth here and there (especially with the women, where there's a bit too much emphasis on love and marriage at the expense of all else), it's really an astounding, moving, frightening and uplifting document. There's no way to watch this remarkable series of films without reflecting deeply on one's own life, and how you have changed (and stayed the same) over your own lifetime.<br /><br />While Michael Aped deserves every bit of credit he's received for this amazing piece of cultural anthropology, it's important to note that the first film, 7 Up,was actually directed by Paul Almond, and Apted was a that point a researcher for the project.",18/08/15

As for the whole show, it is entirely wonderful; the screenplay, the actors, the mystery itself, the delightful atmosphere of a bygone English countryside and era with its leisurely pace of life. There is so much humor and wit in this adaptation (you really have to pay attention and watch multiple times to enjoy some great lol moments) and some pathos as well.

Financier Rex Fortescue (Timothy West) dies suddenly at his office, poisoned by taxine, perhaps from the berries on his family estate, Yewtree Lodge. DI Neele (Tom Wilkinson) and DS Hay (Jon Glover) investigate. Miss Mary Dove (Selina Cadell), who manages the household, calls Fortescue \\""an odious man.\\"" His young widow Adele (Stacy Dorning) is having an affair with her golf instructor. His estranged younger son Lance (Peter Davison) will arrive from Africa shortly. Rex fought with elder son Percival (Clive Merrison) over the business. When another murder occurs, apparently following the nursery rhyme \\""Sing a Song of Sixpence\\"", Miss Marple becomes concerned that her trainee maid Gladys Martin (Annette Badland), now employed at Yewtree Lodge, is in danger.<br /><br />This adaptation by screenwriter T.R. Bowen is largely faithful to the book. The character of Gladys, in particular, I found more convincing than the later 2008 adaptation starring Julia McKenzie, which also did not stray far from Christie's work. It's a solid whodunit in an English country home with sniping family members who all have secrets. Christie has used this plot before. Miss Marple is ahead of the police detectives, as usual. But she is not quite as sharp and testy as she sometimes is, and she gets less screen time than usual. I prefer this adaptation to the later attempt, because I like the cast better, and the style feels more authentic. But I wish Miss Marple had been a stronger presence, as Joan Hickson is so good at conveying her intellect and arrogance. This is probably not one of Christie's stronger novels. The film is a solid adaptation, not an exceptional one, with an excellent cast.",16/08/15

It's admittedly fluffy, but is also very hard to dislike.  The slim plot of sorts: Ted (John Payne), a pianist in a struggling jazz big band headed by Glenn Miller (though he is given another name here), has volunteered for publicity reasons to take a refugee from war torn Norway. He expects to get a small child, but she gets the grown, beautiful Karen Benson (Sonja Henie). Karen is too eager to get involved romantically with Ted, the problem is he already has a girlfriend, the temperamental Viv (played by Lynn Bari), who is also a singer with the band. Henie's character is just short of grating - we are supposed to find her a sympathetic character, and mostly we do, even as she tries to steal a man from other woman. When Ted and Viv go to the ski resort of Sun Valley for a performance there in the middle of the winter, Karen decides to join them hiding in the train with the help of the band manager (Milton Berle).  Of course more than the plot, the important thing here is the music (In the Mood and Chattanooga Choo Choo are some of the pieces included) and Henie's skating. There is also a nifty prolonged scene of Henie pursuing Payne in skis (even if the close ups were obviously filmed in studios, and doubles were used in distant shots).",16/08/15

Steel Cage Match: Hunter Hearst Helmsley w/Chyna vs Mankind<br /><br />This was only the 3rd Steel Cage match to happen at SummerSlam and it was the opening match of the night! The Mankind vs Helmsley feud was an intensely, prolific feud that had undoubtedly heated up in WWF during the summer of 1997 and this match was probably the highlight of their feud from that year. Mankind takes control of the match in the early going and gets aggressive with the blue blood---slowly turning degenerate. Chyna manages to slow his momentum momentarily, choking him with a belt. Mankind continues his onslaught of Helmsley and tries climbing the cage, but Chyna once again interferes and hits a low blow, stopping him in his tracks. Helmsley sees this as a golden opportunity and hits a golden suplex half way off the cage. Mankind begins tasting the cage as HHH tosses him from side to side against the cold, steel iron blue bars. The match becomes aggressively back and forth as the control of the match shifts constantly between Mankind and Helmsley. At one point Mankind cleverly lifts Helmsley up in suplex position and traps his legs in the bars of the cage, leaving him hanging upside down. Mankind rather than climbing the cage, dives into the chest of Helmsley with a running leaping elbow drop.",15/08/15

Five stars.<br /><br />Next in &#34;Sand&#34;, Tarrant finds himself stranded on an eerie green sand-covered planet with Servalan and the planet is inhabited by a mysterious and unseen flesh-eating creature. This one has a good story in it with a lot of suspense and a few scary parts in the first half, but unfortunately, the episode really falls apart during the second half turning a good horror story into a bland and dull soap opera. Pity. Two stars.<br /><br />Overall, this is still worth buying mainly for &#34;Games&#34; which is a fantastic action-packed episode. And even &#34;Sand&#34; has its moments.

It runs just under 88 minutes (including credits) and includes flash-forward sequences at the beginning of the film that seem to have been crudely integrated into the opening reels in some kind of poorly thought-out attempt to 'raise the stakes' or unnecessarily add tension to a scenario that's already rife with it.<br /><br />The alternate version, called &#34;Honor Guard,&#34; I suspect (I've not actually seen it) has a pretty similar running time, has no flash-forwards and its ending is even grimmer than that of &#34;Wolf Lake.&#34; My guess, too, is that this was writer-director Burt Kennedy's original version of the film. I base this on nothing more than supposition and fairly close familiarity with his oeuvre. But I could be totally wrong about that and am open to anyone who knows better telling me otherwise.<br /><br />This film comes at the tail end of the 'backwoods revenge' cycle that started with &#34;Deliverance&#34; and bears some resemblance to other movies in this sub-genre, like &#34;Death Weekend&#34; (1976) and &#34;Open Season&#34; (1974). The cast, as well as the skill of Burt Kennedy behind the camera, elevate what could have otherwise merely been a rote exercise in hippies-vs-old guard rape-&-mayhem flick. It does, perrhaps, aim a little higher than it should in terms of attempts at relevance and depth. But at least it does try and occasionally, even, succeeds, which is more than other films of this ilk do.<br /><br />Plus, you get to see Robin Mattson's boobs.",14/08/15

Electrical power comes from a small bank of solar panel cells that feed electrical current to a capacitor inside the watch. The capacitor essentially acts as a battery and as long as you allow the solar panel cells to absorb some light every day the capacitor will stay charged and keep your watch running perfectly.<br /><br />The biggest &#34;problem&#34; with this watch is the unfortunately long initial charge cycle for the capacitor (an unavoidable flaw in having a battery-free design). The capacitor is completely dead when you first remove the watch from the box, and since the digital components require a &#34;relatively&#34; large amount of voltage the capacitor can't keep up with the demand until it is FULLY charged. This means you have to leave the watch out in the sun (with minimal cloud cover or shade) for a full day and then still charge it under a BRIGHT lamp indoors after the sun goes down for a full night before the capacitor has the charge needed to get started.<br /><br />There is a little &#34;sun&#34; icon that appears below the time if the capacitor is running low. Even after the sun icon disappears during the first day of charging you STILL have to leave the watch out to charge (again a full day of sunlight and a full night of bright lamp light at least) for that first charge.<br /><br />After the capacitor has received a full initial charge you won't have to worry about charging it again as long as you spend at least 45-90 minutes outside every day and the solar panel isn't covered by your shirt sleeve. An hour to an hour and a half of sunlight is all this watch needs to keep running all day and night ... as long as you have given the capacitor a full initial charge.<br /><br />The only other thing I think this watch is missing is a light to allow you to see the time at night. Granted, even a single low-voltage LED would drain the capacitor VERY quickly and defeat the purpose of having a battery-free watch, but it would have been nice to have a light. I suppose I'm willing to put up with the lack of a light if it means I never have to buy another watch battery and never have to remove the cover from the back of this watch.<br /><br />If a solar-powered and battery-free digital watch sounds like a good idea to you then you'll absolutely love this watch. Just understand how the capacitor works and give it that LENGTHY initial charge it needs.eep running all day and night ... as long as you have given the capacitor a full initial charge.<br /><br />The only other thing I think this watch is missing is a light to allow you to see the time at night.

It's not without drawbacks though, to survive the day you will need to use it without the ambient screen on, and that slight delay between raising your wrist up and the screen turning on can be frustrating to some.<br /><br />Having come from a Pebble, not having an always-on display needs some getting used to. While the accelerometer does it's job well in detecting your arm movement to turn on the screen; at times say when you are sitting at a desk and need a quick glance at the time, you'll need to wake the watch up by tapping the screen or pressing the side button - unintuitive.<br /><br />The vibration motor on the Moto 360 is also fairly weak compared to the Pebble, I have missed several notifications because I couldn't feel the vibration. Then again, your experience might vary.<br /><br />Despite being powered by an old TI Omap processor, the watch performs decently with the latest software update. The watch might feel a little sluggish during the first few seconds after turning on the screen but that is definitely not a deal-breaker in my opinion, during normal use it's snappy.<br /><br />Fitness tracking is normal, nothing fancy. However, as mentioned in many other reviews, the heart rate sensor requires you to stay still for it to take a reading, so if you are planning to do some running with HR tracking you will have to look elsewhere. Not having a GPS built-in means you'll need to be tethered to your phone when you go out and hit the road.<br /><br />Overall the Moto 360 is a fairly good buy at $149, considering the LG G Watch R costs twice as much. While it looks pretty, being one of the first Android Wear device means it come with it's own fair share of flaws as well. However, if you can live with these flaws that I've mentioned above (not many), and are looking to buy a smartwatch without breaking the bank, this is a safe bet. It is a beautiful smartwatch that will turn some heads on the street and few might come up to you and ask if that's an Apple Watch.<br /><br />p.s. The successor to the Moto 360 should be announced soon so you might want to think twice before hitting that add to cart button.",30/08/15

I buy two of this watch. It is sold by amazon UK at 18Â£. Amazon don't allow to buy this item from USA to Italy. Recently timex change the name of this watch from atlantis100 to one impersonaly end generical: expedition. that is the name of a line of timex product as iroman,ecc... I prefer atlantis100 because this watch is a sequel of a specific and charaterial model that born with this acquatic name. I love the things that have a story and continuity. A univocal name can give a strong identity,specialistic fashion and plus value to a product. Atlanti100 name strengthened the immagin of this watch in sea and acqua sport scope. Dear timex,was it necessary to change name? You prefer call your watches as expediton t1246322,expedition t63515627,ecc...who are? I know that is difficout and expensive to find a fashion name for mass and economical product models,perhaps your experienc reccomended that it have not sense,but if you have one of them that have just a name,please don't cut it. The custom remember and speak of a product if it have a name,identity and continuity.it is more simply to become best sellers. Anyway Timex brand is a consumer and economic watch producer and they build their watchs in a very good quality standard. The watchs is my passion and i like always looking  for them. in my collection i have a lot of watches, somethings of them stay in a very different expensive level like this but atlantis100 deserves attention because has very special and rare tech spec. it is not simply to find a watch so light and slim that have 100m watet resist limit. The dial of atlantis100 is very '80 fashion,has a sport specialistic and &#34;professional&#34; aspect. the color of display changing if you change the looking inclination.it can appear yellow,green,grey...very,very special. In a first look you can think that the watch is small but it is not true.the dimension is guessed for a watch with essential digital dial,basic functionand that don't want clutter. Who want a very &#34;manly&#34; watch look at other models. The rubber strap is ligth, confortable and frendly to fit. The atlantis100 has all foundamental for a watch:hours,minutes,seconds,day,date,month,alarm,illumination(very good),waterproof(good for acqua sport use)....and plus...timer,stop watch and second time zone. Battery has a very good five years life. The timex atlantis100,with his 30g,is a good partener for summer time,sea activity and sports. It knows get look,it knows get hear (beep),without get feel on wirst. it is a little that can follow you everywere. 18Â£ are a very nice price for a particolar  and reliable watch like this. You can &#34;fall in love&#34; of it.",30/08/15

I'm only mentioning this because, in the price range of the SMARTE, it is decent value within a somewhat narrow universe of buyers.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />The One Feature That Makes It Worthwhile to One Subgroup<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Right off the bat, the biggest benefit is that streams notifications -- as long as you have an Android phone. My primary phone is currently a iPhone 6 Plus. But I was able to test this using my old LG G2 and, sure enough, notifications from apps that were able to limp along on Wifi only came through on this watch after I paired.<br /><br />Why is this such a big deal? Well, what gets me paying attention phone are notifications, i.e. text messages, emails and reminders. As has been the case with my Microsoft Band, which I use more than the Apple Watch, because the battery drain is less of a hassle, I can be more selective about the instances in which I'll take my phone out of my pocket because I can see it on my watch.<br /><br />So now, you can that at a low price point, as long as you're on an Android phone.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />The Rest of Story...Not as Quite as Impressive<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />In most other instances, the SMARTE Watch in not in same league of high tier watches such the Apple, Microsofts, and LGs...or even mid-tier smart watches such as the Pebbles, Samsungs, and Jawbones. It has non-HD screen that will seem pretty retro compared with you low resolution compared along-side your phone. When I say retro, I don't mean Game Boy retro, which is viewed as hip in some circles. I mean retro as in Palm Pilot (although in color).<br /><br />Other impressions:<br /><br />â™¦ Upon opening, it has the appearance of being higher-end that it actually is. It's got a nice band with rubber texture. Adjustable too ...I think it fit most wrists. Since it goes into power save mode and your screen is off most of the time people can really tell what it is until you turn the screen on.<br />â™¦ It's got a touch screen, which allow you access all it's function, such as: time, date, calculator, and pedometer. However, I did not find the touch screen to be as responsive the smart phones have been for the past three years.<br /><br />To be fair, my review is in the context of Android phone uses because of the notifications. iPhone uses should probably not consider it.<br /><br />Overall, I'd give it 3 1/2 stars, but since Amazon does not have rating available, I'll give it four stars.<br /><br />Got this at no cost for unbiased review.<br /><br />âˆž PositiveLogicpressions:<br /><br />â™¦ Upon opening, it has the appearance of being higher-end that it actually is.

When The Shipment came in the next day, It looked flawless.  The box was perfect and the watch came with everything and even a little more like clothes and a manual.  When I first tried it on,  It wasnt even a close fit.  Unless you are a 280lb 6''4' lumberjack, there is no way this watch is going to fit you without taking out a few links.  I am 5''10' and about 150lbs and it fits perfectly with 1-2 links taken out from each side.  I managed to be able to do this at my house withing like 10 minutes but without the proper experience and equiptment, you probably should take it to a professional to adjust.  After getting the fit, the watch itself looks beautiful.  The 23k gold trim and the blue looks amazing.  Almost exactly like the rolex submariner collection,  but I didnt even buy this to be a copy which is the good thing.  Now every watch has its pros and cons so let me go over those.<br /><br />Pros.<br /><br />Probably the nicest looking watch for under $100 basicly a steal<br /><br />Water resistant up to 200 meters (about 600 feet)<br />you should have no problem taking it to the pool, beach ect.<br /><br />Clasp is nice and gold plating is done nicely<br /><br />Winding and timer feature (manually)<br /><br />Very interesting back of the watch that is transparent<br />so you could see inside<br /><br />This seems a little gimmicky but the glow in the dark feature on this<br />watch is probably the best on any watch.  I am so used to it now.  Just<br />be sure to get it some sunlight or else it wont glow<br /><br />Now with all the pros there are obviously cons.<br /><br />Watch is only gold plated (which is expected for the price) meaning it scratches<br />very easily.<br /><br />Not a self winding watch so it loses I would say about 20-30 seconds a day<br />not a big deal for me but it might be for some people.  I just usually wind it every 2<br />weeks.<br /><br />Very flashy (which is for me a pro) but you might not like that.  I have people approach me from several feet<br />away asking about this watch so if you want to be like a fly on the wall, don't get this.<br /><br />Winding is a little tough but easy after getting used to.<br /><br />For me this watch is a definite buy for someone who wants to make a statement and is looking for an attention seeking watch beacuse trust me, 10s of people will approach you all the time (especially at my age)  It is the nicest watch in this pricepoint but if you are looking for a watch just to tell the time perfectly by the second, then this would not be recomended.  Overall a beautiful watch but it just depends what you like for in a watch<br /><br />Flashy, Pretty, Cool Features= buy<br /><br />Something to tell precise time, not very flashy/not trying to show off= don't buy<br /><br />Overall<br />I would recomemend this watch to about 85% of the people i knowht be for some people.

I just am skeptical because the Timex box it came in was tampered with.  Part of the box was cut out and I wonder why.  I have resubmitted my review because there is now a problem with the watch band.  A pin came out of the band and now the band it detached.  The pin must have come out while wearing the watch and now it cannot be worn without some repair work.  I did not get 3 months use from this watch.,30/08/15

I thought the lack of an additional sensor and bells and whistles from the rangeman would impact the watches performance. However, I can say that I prefer this watch because for me the watch face is more readible (less cluttered) and the watch is easier to operate. There are no accidental mode changes from the mode button mashing into my wrist, a common fault I found with the rangeman. As always, the mudman is a fantastic g-shock watch with all the quality you'd expect. Compass and moon phase function without error. For the price I dont think I would pick another watch.

Not intuitive configuration and needed 20 minutes with the manual to set it and understand it. Haven't used a watch in 12+ years but it's a pain to dig out a phone to see the time when a flick of the wrist in a third of a second can tell me. Mineral glass should keep it lasting for years. Auto calendar good until 2099. +/- 30 seconds a month accuracy. Alarm tone is loud enough without being blaring although I doubt it would wake most people. Manual says 10 months of battery assuming 18 hours of display and 6 hours of sleep (it goes to sleep in dark conditions to conserve, light and hitting a button wakes it). ONLY the small digital display lights up so don't think you can use this to walk down a dark hallway. The analog hands are moved by magnetic force so that part of the timekeeping will be affected if you have the watch near magnets and you'll need to re-adjust. It isn't a G-Shock so big impacts or wearing it while using a chainsaw could cause it to malfunction. All in all a great watch to survive daily life if you don't need extra features.",30/08/15

Two-months out for parts!!","First, this is a very light and wearable watch. About the thinnest I could find in a day/date automatic with 200m ISO dive rated watch.<br /><br />Loved the watch until the second time I actually went diving with it (about the 5th time wearing it for less than a day). The diving wasn't the problem, it was after that I unscrewed the crown to adjust seconds (yes, it's a hacking movement, I also like that) and it would not, could not screw back down, no matter what I tried. Had the dive master at the shop try, another customer who had the same problem with a Tag tried. Nada. So it was no longer divable. Worse, I can't even use the watch since without screwing the crown down, there is no seal at all, even humidity would get in there. So for the price I paid and having used it for two dives and maybe five-days of wearing, this has become a monumental fail.<br /><br />Add to the fail: Mido parts (crown, stem, tube needed, according to repairer) are two-months out to get. Nice. I'm heading overseas in a matter of weeks and will be doing underwater research again, so many dive trips. NOT happy. Hopefully with this caveat I'll save others from the same fate (but hope others don't have the same experience!)<br /><br />-------------<br />Edit: Finally got it back &#34;repaired,&#34; saw the watch at the Mido dealer, inside the back it says, &#34;Hong Kong.&#34; They had to explain the case is made in China. Well..., one more dive in Thailand and, you guessed it. Something went amiss inside. Took it to a Mido repair center all the way up in Chiang Mai. They had for a week, all was well. For a few weeks. Just before flying out of Thailand I had the audacity to actually use the watch. BIG mistake. Unscrewing the crown (which had to have a new crown and tube put in, AFTER the Mido dealer in the US put a new crown and tube in - I think they knackered it, actually), the crown just came out, with the stem. Out of the watch. Completely. Great. This is the biggest POS of a &#34;Swiss watch&#34; I've ever own. Timex would be more reliable and for what I paid for this watch and all the repairs for wearing overall less than two-weeks, I could have bought enough Timex's to last me and my entire family ten-generations of time keeping. Anytime I see someone looking at a Mido, I relate this experience. Mido..., rhymes with, Yugo. Remember them, the cars that fell apart while you drove them? Same thing here...",30/08/15

I got it for use when kicking and paragliding.<br /><br />I like it a lot. It's touch and functional.<br /><br />But there are some short comings:<br /><br />1) It's hard to read at low light. The light stays on for three seconds. That's okay for reading the time, but 3 seconds to read the compass, barometer and altimeter... not long enough. Along with the 3 second issue, I really wish that Casio and Timex got together for some sexy time and made one of these with &#34;Indiglow&#34; light tech.<br /><br />2) If you're an adult, it will remove all hair from your wrist... all of it. It's as if the engineers that design the watch spend most of the time and budget figuring out how to turn the band into the most efficient hair removal device ever invented. On a positive note, after only two days of wearing the watch, my wrist is as smooth as a baby's bottom... so smooth!<br /><br />3) The thermometer is supposed to tell you the temperature in the air around you. It does not. It tells you the temperature of your wrist. Removing the watch so as to get a proper temp reading, results in the removal of more hairs off your wrist. Choose your battles carefully.<br /><br />That's pretty much it.<br /><br />I still like the watch and would recommend it to friends.",30/08/15

It ticks fine and has the nice Indiglo back light. The proble that this watch has is that it is very easily scratches. I have a gouge on the face of mine that looks like someone dragged a drill across the face. Not sure how it got that way, but I only ever wear it to work (at a bakery). That being said, I have had two of these. The first one I had, the crown fell off. Again, no clue how, just looked at it and it was gone. I was given a replacement by Amazon, but that did not change the quality of the watch. If you're looking for something that looks good and is not over priced, this is a good watch, just don't expect too much from it.<br /><br />Update: This is the last timex watch I will ever buy for more than $30. I used this watch for work and it could not hold up to my working conditions. I work at a gun range and also a bakery. Within one week of working the crystal sported a great gouge in and made it annoying to look at. This watch was also marred by smaller scratches from everyday use which made it look like someone had taken sandpaper to it. I quit wearing it regularly and made it a strictly work only watch. However after two weeks the watch met its end. The &#34;crystal&#34; had shattered and the watch was unreadable, ceasing to function. I didnt notice until I got home at the end of the night that it was in this condition. I didnt remember hitting my wrist hard on anything as I usually do if I smack my watch up against something, fearing that I may have damaged or broken it. But in this case I didnt notice or the actual hit which was the death blow must not have been that hard. The bottom line though is that this watch could not stand up to a couple weeks of normal wear and tear at work. I might pay $20 for this watch again, but certainly not the current (4/18/17) asking price of over $100.
